## Overview

At the surface, this project is about learning and recognizing common ruby errors.  But it's really about training you to think like an engineer.

You'll be better at solving a bug on your own, even when you don't know the answer at first.  Rather than teaching you separate nuggets of knowledge about ruby, this project teaches you how to fish.  And how to solve your problem on your own, every time.

## Instructions

Disclaimer: Please do NOT look up the correct code on the master branch during the project.  This is cheating and will defy the entire purpose of the project.  We will come after your firstborn.

1.  Clone this repo to your computer.  Run `git clone #{ADD URL HERE}`
2.  Start on the `master` branch, which has a working version of the game.
3.  Run `ruby sudoku.rb` and fill a few spots to get a feel for how the game *should* work with correct code.
4.  Starting with level-1, for each level:
    1. Check out that level's code (i.e., run `git checkout level-1`, `git checkout level-2`, etc.).
    2. Run `ruby sudoku.rb` and try to fill a few spots.  There are no bugs that you can't catch in more than two turns.
    3. Your game will break somehow.
    4. Figure out how to fix it using the strategies you've learned.  You are allowed to write extra code, new methods, etc.  You are allowed to use the scientific method.  Your approaches can be creative.
    5. Ask students near you if you run out of approaches and are dumbfounded for more than 5 minutes.
    6. Run `ruby sudoku.rb` and make sure the game plays like the master version.


## You finished???

Excellent sleuthing, Holmes.

Make up three new levels (each on different branches) with three new tricky errors.  Submit those levels as pull requests to the repo.
